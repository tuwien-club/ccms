## [](#quick-start)Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

-   [Docker](#setup-with-docker)
-   [Python Virtual Environment](#setup-with-python-virtual-environment)

## [](#setup-with-docker)Setup with Docker

### Dependencies

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuwien-club/ccms.git
cd Wagtail-Template
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose up
```

The demo site will now be accessible at <http://localhost:8000/>.

**Important:** This `docker-compose.yml` is configured for local testing only, and is _not_ intended for production use.

### Debugging

To tail the logs from the Docker containers in realtime, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## [](#setup-with-python-virtual-environment)Setup with Python Virtual Environment

You can start a Wagtail project from this template without setting up Docker and simply use a virtual environment,
which is the [recommended installation approach](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for all Python projects itself.

### Dependencies

-   Python 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7

### Installation

With [PIP](https://github.com/pypa/pip) installed, run:

    git clone https://github.com/tuwien-club/ccms.git
    cd Wagtail-Template
    python --version
    python -m pip --version

Confirm that this is showing a compatible version of Python 3.x. If not, and you have multiple versions
of Python installed on your system, you may need to specify the appropriate version when creating the venv:

    python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

Once a virtual environment has been created, it can be “activated” using a script in the virtual environment’s
binary directory. The invocation of the script is platform-specific (<venv> must be replaced by the path of the
directory containing the virtual environment):

| Platform | Shell      | Command to activate virtual environment |
| :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Posix    | bash/zsh   | \$ source <venv>/bin/activate      |
|          | fish       | \$ . <venv>/bin/activate.fish      |
|          | csh/tcsh   | \$ source <venv>/bin/activate.csh  |
| Windows  | cmd.exe    | C:> <venv>\\Scripts\\activate.bat       |
|          | PowerShell | PS C:> <venv>\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1    |

Now we're ready to set up the project itself:

    pip install -r requirements/base.txt

To set up your database and load initial data, run the following commands:

    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py runserver
